# Mini-Project: AI-Based Signal Strength Prediction for FWA CPE Placement
## Goal:
Build a simple machine learning model that predicts signal strength (RSSI or SINR) based on environmental features to ***suggest optimal placement*** for a CPE device.

##ðŸ§  Step-by-Step Process
  1. **Install & Import Libraries** â€“ pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and more.
  2. **Load Dataset** â€“ Imported a sample dataset from GitHub representing FWA conditions.
  3. **Explore the Data** â€“ Checked distributions, datatypes, and cleaned inconsistencies.
  4. **Preprocess Features** â€“ One-hot encoded categorical variables and scaled numeric ones.
  5. **Train/Test Split** â€“ Split the data for model validation.
  6. **Train Model** â€“ Used a Random Forest Regressor for prediction.
  7. **Prediction Example** â€“ Predicted signal strength based on specific input conditions.
  8. **Visualize as Heatmap** â€“ Created a heatmap of predicted signal strength by distance & elevation.
  9. **Interactive Sliders** â€“ Built an interactive UI with ipywidgets to simulate real-world placement scenarios.

##ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways
âœ… Built an ML model with MAE ~1.98 dB and RÂ² ~0.989
âœ… Visualized optimal placement regions via signal strength heatmaps
âœ… Added an interactive dashboard to simulate deployment conditions
âœ… A great step toward AI-assisted network planning in telecom
