# Mini-Project: AI-Based Signal Strength Prediction for FWA CPE Placement
## Goal:
Build a simple machine learning model that predicts signal strength (RSSI or SINR) based on environmental features to ***suggest optimal placement*** for a CPE device.

## Step-by-Step Process
  1. **Install & Import Libraries** – pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and more.
  2. **Load Dataset** – Imported a sample dataset from GitHub representing FWA conditions.
  3. **Explore the Data** – Checked distributions, datatypes, and cleaned inconsistencies.
  4. **Preprocess Features** – One-hot encoded categorical variables and scaled numeric ones.
  5. **Train/Test Split** – Split the data for model validation.
  6. **Train Model** – Used a Random Forest Regressor for prediction.
  7. **Prediction Example** – Predicted signal strength based on specific input conditions.
  8. **Visualize as Heatmap** – Created a heatmap of predicted signal strength by distance & elevation.
  9. **Interactive Sliders** – Built an interactive UI with ipywidgets to simulate real-world placement scenarios.

## Key Takeaways
  ✅ Built an ML model with MAE ~1.98 dB and R² ~0.989
  
  ✅ Visualized optimal placement regions via signal strength heatmaps
  
  ✅ Added an interactive dashboard to simulate deployment conditions
  
  ✅ A great step toward AI-assisted network planning in telecom
